This app fullfills a simple need: Take a list of names of people attending a meeting and peform one (or multiple) of the following tasks:

* ✂️ Split their names into first name and surname
* 👀 Compare two lists with each other and see who is new on the second list
* 🔎 Find people in a list by either searching for their complete names or parts of their name
* 💾 Write any of the results back out, so you can share it with others
