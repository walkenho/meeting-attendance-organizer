# 📅 Meeting Attendance Organizer

This app, which is currently [deployed live on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/walkenho/meeting-attendance-organizer) fullfills a simple need: It lets users upload one or more lists of names of people attending a meeting and performs the following tasks:

* ✂️ Split attendee names into first name and surname.
* 👀 Compare two lists of attendees with each other and see who is new on the second list.
* 🔎 Find people in a list by either searching for their complete names or parts of their name
* 💾 Write any of the results back out, so you can share it with others.
